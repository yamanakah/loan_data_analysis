    "> The dataset in this report contains 113,937 loans from the Prosper marketplace. It provides borrower and loan characteristics with 81 variables such as loan amount, interest rate, loan status, borrower income, employment status, credit history, etc.\n",

    "> Prosper is a US-based peer-to-peer lending marketplace. Borrowers can request personal loans on Prosper and individual or institutional investors can fund anywhere from $2,000 to $35,000 per loan request. Investors can consider borrowersâ€™ credit scores, ratings, and histories and the category of the loan. Prosper handles the servicing of the loan and collects and distributes borrower payments and interest back to the loan investors.\n",
